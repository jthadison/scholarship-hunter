Evaluate this scholarship essay on a 0-100 scale across these dimensions:

1. **Memorability (0-100)**: Is it unique, engaging, and stands out? Does it avoid clichÃ©s? Is there a compelling narrative or unique angle?
2. **Emotional Impact (0-100)**: Does it resonate emotionally with readers? Is there vulnerability, depth, and authentic emotion?
3. **Authenticity (0-100)**: Does it feel genuine and personal, not AI-generated or template-based? Are there specific details, names, and experiences?
4. **Prompt Alignment (0-100)**: Does it address all prompt requirements effectively and completely? Is the response focused and relevant?
5. **Technical Quality (0-100)**: Grammar, clarity, structure, readability, and flow (note: I'll provide technical analysis separately)

**Essay Prompt:**
${prompt}

**Essay Content:**
${essayContent}

**Technical Analysis (reference for Technical Quality dimension):**
- Grammar errors: ${technicalReport.grammarErrors.length}
- Style issues: ${technicalReport.styleIssues.length}
- Readability grade level: ${readabilityMetrics.fleschKincaidGradeLevel}
- Avg words per sentence: ${readabilityMetrics.sentenceComplexity.avgWordsPerSentence}

For each dimension:
- Provide a score (0-100)
- Explain the score in 2-3 sentences focusing on strengths and weaknesses
- Identify 1-2 specific improvements

Also provide:
- Overall effectiveness score (weighted average)
- 3-6 prioritized improvement suggestions with:
  - Priority level (critical/important/optional)
  - Issue description
  - Location (which section/paragraph)
  - Specific recommendation
  - Expected score impact (e.g., "+8 points to Memorability")
- List any grammar/style concerns not caught by automated checks
- Authenticity warnings if content feels AI-generated or generic (be specific about what feels inauthentic)

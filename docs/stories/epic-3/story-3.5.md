# Story 3.5: Timeline Generation & Optimization

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a student,
I want an optimized timeline for each application,
So that I know when to start each task and avoid last-minute scrambling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Timeline algorithm generates 5 key milestones working backward from deadline: Start essay (X days before deadline), Request recommendations (Y days before), Upload documents (Z days before), Final review (3 days before), Submit (1 day buffer)
2. Timeline factors in application complexity: More essays = earlier start date (3 days per essay), more recommendations = more lead time (7 days per rec letter)
3. Conflict detection algorithm warns if multiple applications have overlapping intensive work periods (same week has >15 estimated hours)
4. Visual timeline display: Calendar view showing all milestones across applications color-coded by priority tier and urgency level
5. Timeline adjusts dynamically: If student starts late or misses milestone, system recalculates remaining milestones and updates recommended completion dates
6. Recommended start dates displayed prominently: "Start this application by [Date] to avoid stress" with justification based on complexity
7. Performance requirement: Generate timeline calculation in <100ms per application, including conflict detection across student's full pipeline

## Dev Notes

### Timeline Algorithm Design Philosophy

The timeline generation algorithm follows **backward planning** methodology used in project management:

1. **Start with deadline** (immutable constraint)
2. **Work backward** calculating optimal dates for each milestone
3. **Buffer for safety** (1-day submission buffer prevents last-minute technical issues)
4. **Complexity-based scaling** (more work = earlier start dates)
5. **Human-realistic estimation** (2.5 hours per complexity point based on research)

**Why these specific thresholds?**
- **1-day submit buffer**: Scholarship portals often have technical issues or timezone confusion
- **3-day final review**: Enough time for fresh-eyes review and addressing quality issues
- **7-day document upload**: Allows time to request transcripts from schools, scan documents
- **14+ day rec requests**: Teachers need adequate notice; some require 2-3 weeks
- **3 days per complexity point for essays**: Research shows 3 days per quality 500-word essay (draft → revise → polish)

### Complexity Scoring Rationale

**Formula: `complexity = essayCount + (recCount * 2)`**

Why recommendations weighted 2x essays?
- Essays are student-controlled (can work anytime)
- Recommendations depend on teacher availability (asynchronous dependency)
- Requesting recs requires additional coordination overhead
- Teachers may need follow-up reminders (adds uncertainty)

**Example calculations:**
- 1 essay, 0 recs = complexity 1 → 14 days lead time, 2.5 hours
- 2 essays, 1 rec = complexity 4 → 12 days lead time, 10 hours
- 3 essays, 2 recs = complexity 7 → 21 days lead time, 17.5 hours

### Conflict Detection Strategy

**What constitutes a "conflict"?**
- Same calendar week has >15 estimated hours across multiple applications
- Based on research: Students can sustain ~10-15 hours/week on extracurricular activities
- Exceeding this threshold leads to burnout and quality degradation

**Conflict resolution recommendations:**
1. **Defer IF_TIME_PERMITS applications** to following week
2. **Distribute high-complexity applications** across multiple weeks
3. **Start early** on MUST_APPLY scholarships to avoid compression
4. **Warn proactively** when adding application that creates conflict

**Visual conflict indicators:**
- Calendar: Yellow stripe on conflicted weeks
- Application cards: "⚠️ Conflict" badge
- Dashboard banner: "Warning: Nov 1-7 has 3 overlapping applications"

### Dynamic Recalculation Logic

**Triggers for recalculation:**
1. Student starts application late (today > startEssayDate)
2. Student completes milestone ahead of schedule
3. Deadline changes (scholarship extends deadline)
4. Complexity changes (scholarship adds essay requirement)

**Recalculation behavior:**
- **Don't change past dates** (already missed milestones are historical)
- **Compress remaining timeline** proportionally
- **Warn if deadline at-risk** (compressed timeline unrealistic)
- **Suggest deferring low-priority work** if multiple conflicts

**Example scenario:**
- Original timeline: Start essay Nov 1, deadline Nov 30 (30 days)
- Student starts late: Today is Nov 10 (20 days remaining)
- Recalculated: Start essay NOW, request recs Nov 12 (compressed from Nov 8), final review Nov 27 (same), submit Nov 29 (same)
- Warning: "⚠️ You're 9 days behind. Complete essay by Nov 15 to stay on track."

### Calendar Visualization Design

**Calendar component features:**
- **Month view**: See all applications across 30-day window
- **Week view**: Detailed view of specific week with hourly breakdown
- **Milestone markers**: Icons differentiate essay (✍️), recs (📧), docs (📄), review (🔍), submit (✅)
- **Color coding by priority tier**: MUST_APPLY (green), SHOULD_APPLY (blue), IF_TIME_PERMITS (yellow), REACH (orange)
- **Hover interactions**: Tooltip shows full details without navigating away
- **Click interactions**: Navigate to application workspace for that milestone

**Mobile considerations:**
- Month view shows compact day markers
- Tap day opens bottom sheet with full milestone list
- Swipe between months
- "This week" quick filter

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add Timeline model with relationships
- `src/server/api/routers/timeline.ts` - tRPC routes for timeline operations
- `src/server/services/timeline/generate.ts` - Core `generateOptimizedTimeline()` function
- `src/server/services/timeline/conflicts.ts` - Conflict detection logic
- `src/server/services/timeline/recalculate.ts` - Dynamic timeline adjustment
- `src/components/timeline/TimelineCalendar.tsx` - Calendar visualization component
- `src/components/timeline/MilestoneMarker.tsx` - Individual milestone display
- `src/components/timeline/RecommendedStartDate.tsx` - Start date recommendation component
- `src/components/timeline/ConflictWarning.tsx` - Conflict alert component
- `src/hooks/useTimeline.ts` - Client hook for timeline state management

**Database migration:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Timeline" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "applicationId" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  "startEssayDate" TIMESTAMP,
  "requestRecsDate" TIMESTAMP,
  "uploadDocsDate" TIMESTAMP,
  "finalReviewDate" TIMESTAMP,
  "submitDate" TIMESTAMP,
  "hasConflicts" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  "conflictsWith" TEXT[],
  "estimatedHours" REAL,
  FOREIGN KEY ("applicationId") REFERENCES "Application"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX "Timeline_applicationId_idx" ON "Timeline"("applicationId");
```

**Alignment with Tech Stack:**
- State management: React Query for server state, Zustand for UI state (per tech spec)
- UI components: shadcn/ui Calendar component as base (per tech spec)
- Date calculations: `date-fns` library (differenceInDays, subDays, startOfWeek)
- Calendar: FullCalendar or custom shadcn/ui implementation

### Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Deadline too close** - If deadline is <7 days away, timeline generation should compress milestones and show warning
2. **Very complex applications** - If complexity >10 (e.g., 6 essays + 2 recs), timeline may require >30 days; warn student early
3. **Past deadline** - If today > deadline, don't generate timeline; show "Deadline passed" message
4. **No essays/recs required** - Some scholarships only need form submission; timeline should reflect minimal work
5. **Concurrent editing** - If multiple users (student + counselor) edit application simultaneously, use optimistic locking
6. **Timezone handling** - Deadlines are typically 11:59 PM in scholarship's local timezone; store as UTC, display in student's timezone

2. Eligibility breakdown: Shows which criteria student meets (checkmarks) vs. doesn't meet (X marks)
3. Match score with dimensional breakdown: "Overall: 88 - Academic: 95, Demographic: 100, Experience: 70"
4. Success probability and tier classification: "72% - Strong Match"
5. Application requirements: Essays (prompts, word counts), documents needed, recommendations required
6. Competition context: Estimated applicant pool, historical acceptance rate
7. Call-to-action buttons: "Add to My Applications", "View Provider Website"
8. Mobile-responsive layout

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Detail Page Design:**
- **Comprehensive Information Hub**: Single page provides all information needed for student to evaluate scholarship and decide to apply
- **Match-First Presentation**: For authenticated students, match score and eligibility are prominently displayed to guide decision-making
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential info (name, award, deadline) at top, detailed requirements below, competition context further down
- **Action-Oriented**: Clear CTAs ("Add to My Applications") enable immediate action without navigation

**Data Flow:**
1. User clicks scholarship from search results → Navigate to `/scholarships/[id]`
2. Page loads → Fetch scholarship data + student match (if authenticated)
3. Display all sections with match score, eligibility breakdown, requirements, competition context
4. User clicks "Add to My Applications" → Create application record → Show confirmation
5. User navigates to application workspace (Story 3.8 dependency)

**Eligibility Comparison Logic:**
- **Met (✓)**: Student profile satisfies criterion completely (e.g., GPA 3.7 meets requirement of 3.5+)
- **Not Met (✗)**: Student profile fails criterion (e.g., GPA 3.2 doesn't meet 3.5+)
- **Partially Met (~)**: Student meets some but not all aspects (e.g., 80 volunteer hours when 100 required = 80% partial match)

**Mobile Responsiveness:**
- Desktop: Two-column layout (match/eligibility left, requirements/competition right)
- Tablet: Stacked sections with full width
- Mobile: Single column, collapsible sections to reduce scroll length

### Component Relationships

**Backend:**
- `src/server/routers/scholarship.ts` - scholarship.getById procedure (from Story 2.8)
- `src/server/routers/application.ts` - application.create mutation (new)
- `src/server/lib/matching/compare-eligibility.ts` - Eligibility comparison logic
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Scholarship, Match, Application models

**Frontend:**
- `src/pages/scholarships/[id].tsx` - Main detail page
- `src/components/scholarships/ScholarshipDetailHeader.tsx` - Header section
- `src/components/scholarships/MatchScoreSection.tsx` - Match score display
- `src/components/scholarships/EligibilityBreakdown.tsx` - Eligibility criteria comparison
- `src/components/scholarships/ApplicationRequirements.tsx` - Requirements section
- `src/components/scholarships/CompetitionContext.tsx` - Competition info section
- `src/components/scholarships/AddToApplicationsButton.tsx` - CTA button with mutation

**State Management:**
- URL parameter: scholarshipId (dynamic route)
- tRPC query: scholarship.getById (fetch scholarship + match)
- tRPC mutation: application.create (add to applications)
- Local state: Loading, error, success confirmation

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Test eligibility comparison function (met/not met/partial logic)
- Test effort level calculation from essay/document/rec requirements
- Test competition level categorization logic

**Integration Tests:**
- Test `scholarship.getById` returns full scholarship with match data
- Test `application.create` creates Application record successfully
- Test duplicate application handling (returns error or existing app)

**E2E Tests:**
- User navigates to detail page → sees all sections rendered correctly
- Authenticated user sees match score section with dimensional breakdown
- User clicks "Add to My Applications" → application created → confirmation shown
- User clicks "View Provider Website" → new tab opens with correct URL
- Mobile user views detail page → sections stack vertically

### Project Structure Notes

**File Locations (aligned with unified-project-structure.md):**
- Detail page: `src/pages/scholarships/[id].tsx`
- Scholarship router: `src/server/routers/scholarship.ts`
- Application router: `src/server/routers/application.ts` (new)
- Eligibility logic: `src/server/lib/matching/compare-eligibility.ts`
- Detail components: `src/components/scholarships/`
- Tests: `src/__tests__/scholarships/detail/`

**Naming Conventions:**
- Page files: `[id].tsx` (Next.js dynamic route)
- Components: PascalCase (`ScholarshipDetailHeader`, `EligibilityBreakdown`)
- tRPC procedures: camelCase (`scholarship.getById`, `application.create`)

- [PRD](../PRD.md#scholarship-database--discovery) - FR007 scholarship detail display requirement

**Architecture Context:**
- Story 2.9 depends on Story 2.4 (Match Scoring) - match score displayed prominently
- Story 2.9 depends on Story 2.5 (Success Probability) - probability shown in detail
- Story 2.9 depends on Story 2.7 (Priority Tiering) - tier badge displayed in header
- Story 2.9 depends on Story 2.8 (Search Interface) - search results link to detail pages
- Story 2.9 enables Story 3.2 (Add to Applications) - "Add to My Applications" button creates application
- Story 2.9 feeds into Story 4.6 (Essay Prompt Analysis) - essay prompts displayed here

**Technology Stack:**
- Next.js dynamic routing for `/scholarships/[id]` page
- tRPC for scholarship.getById and application.create endpoints
- Prisma for database queries (Scholarship, Match, Application)
- Tailwind CSS for responsive layout
- Radix UI for accessible components (collapsible sections, tooltips)

**Key Implementation:**
```typescript
// From tech-spec-epic-2.md lines 146-158
export const scholarshipRouter = router({
  getById: publicProcedure
    .input(z.string())
    .query(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      return prisma.scholarship.findUnique({
        where: { id: input },
        include: {
          matches: {
            where: { studentId: ctx.user?.studentId },
            take: 1
          }
        }
      })
    }),
})
```

**Eligibility Comparison:**
```typescript
// Eligibility comparison logic
function compareEligibility(
  studentProfile: Profile,
  eligibilityCriteria: EligibilityCriteria
): EligibilityResult {
  const results = []

  // Academic comparison
  if (eligibilityCriteria.minGPA) {
    const met = studentProfile.gpa >= eligibilityCriteria.minGPA
    results.push({
      category: 'Academic',
      requirement: `GPA: ${eligibilityCriteria.minGPA}+`,
      studentValue: `You: ${studentProfile.gpa}`,
      status: met ? 'met' : 'not_met'
    })
  }

  // Demographic comparison
  if (eligibilityCriteria.requiredGender) {
    const met = studentProfile.gender === eligibilityCriteria.requiredGender
    results.push({
      category: 'Demographic',
      requirement: `Gender: ${eligibilityCriteria.requiredGender}`,
      studentValue: `You: ${studentProfile.gender}`,
      status: met ? 'met' : 'not_met'
    })
  }

  // ... more comparisons

  return { results, overallStatus: calculateOverallStatus(results) }
}
```

**Application Creation:**
```typescript
// application.create mutation
export const applicationRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ scholarshipId: z.string() }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      const student = await getStudent(ctx.user.id)
      const scholarship = await prisma.scholarship.findUnique({
        where: { id: input.scholarshipId }
      })

      // Check for duplicate
      const existing = await prisma.application.findUnique({
        where: {
          studentId_scholarshipId: {
            studentId: student.id,
            scholarshipId: input.scholarshipId
          }
        }
      })

      if (existing) {
        throw new TRPCError({
          code: 'CONFLICT',
          message: 'Application already exists'
        })
      }

      // Create application
      return prisma.application.create({
        data: {
          studentId: student.id,
          scholarshipId: input.scholarshipId,
          status: 'TODO',
          deadline: scholarship.deadline,
        }
      })
    })
})
```

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary (2025-10-26):**

Story 2.9 successfully implemented a comprehensive scholarship detail page with all required functionality. All acceptance criteria have been met, with 624 tests passing (including 21 new unit tests for eligibility comparison logic).

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Enhanced `scholarship.getById` tRPC endpoint with all dimensional scores and match metadata
- ✅ Created complete application router with `create`, `list`, and `delete` mutations for managing student applications
- ✅ Built 6 reusable React components for scholarship detail display (Header, MatchScore, Eligibility, Requirements, Competition, Page)
- ✅ Implemented intelligent eligibility comparison utility with met/not met/partially met logic
- ✅ Responsive mobile-first design with collapsible sections and sticky CTAs
- ✅ Full type safety with TypeScript and Zod validation
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests covering all eligibility criteria types

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Used server-side eligibility comparison to avoid exposing student profile data to client unnecessarily
- Implemented collapsible sections with Radix UI for accessibility and mobile responsiveness
- Circular progress indicator for overall match score provides intuitive visual feedback
- Color-coded dimensional breakdown uses traffic light pattern (green/yellow/red) for quick assessment
- Share functionality uses native Web Share API with clipboard fallback for broad browser support

**User Experience Highlights:**
- Breadcrumb navigation enables easy return to search
- Priority tier badges provide instant visual prioritization
- "Why this match?" explanation helps students understand their fit
- Estimated application time helps students plan their workload
- Competition context helps set realistic expectations

**Testing Coverage:**
- 21 unit tests for eligibility comparison covering all criterion types and edge cases
- All existing 603 tests continue to pass (no regressions)
- Test coverage includes academic, demographic, major/field, experience, financial, and special criteria
- Edge cases tested: missing data, empty criteria, multiple criteria combinations

**Technical Debt / Future Enhancements:**
- Integration and E2E tests for detail page components (11.2-11.7) - deferred for future story
- Match recalculation endpoint (referenced in MatchScoreSection) - Story 2.13 dependency
- Bookmark functionality (Task 10.2) marked optional - can be added in future enhancement
